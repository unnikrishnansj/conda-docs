                 RECIPE_PATH [RECIPE_PATH ...]
   
          Tool  for  building conda packages. A conda package is a binary tarball
          containing system-level libraries, Python modules, executable programs,
          or other components. conda keeps track of dependencies between packages
          and platform specifics, making it simple to create working environments
          from different sets of packages.
   
      positional arguments:
          RECIPE_PATH
                 Path  to  recipe  directory. Pass 'purge' here to clean the work
                 and test intermediates.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -V, --version
                 Show the conda-build version number and exit.
   
          -n, --no-source
                 When templating can't be completed, do not obtain the source  to
                 try fill in related template variables.
   
          --output
                 Output the conda package filename which would have been created
   
          --python PYTHON
                 Set the Python version used by conda build.
   
          --perl PERL
                 Set the Perl version used by conda build.
   
          --numpy NUMPY
                 Set the NumPy version used by conda build.
   
          --R R_BASE
                 Set the R version used by conda build.
   
          --lua LUA
                 Set the Lua version used by conda build.
   
          --bootstrap BOOTSTRAP
                 Provide  initial  configuration in addition to recipe.  Can be a
                 path to or name of an environment, which will be emulated in the
                 package.
   
          --append-file APPEND_SECTIONS_FILE
                 Append  data in meta.yaml with fields from this file.  Jinja2 is
                 not done on appended fields
   
          --clobber-file CLOBBER_SECTIONS_FILE
                 Clobber data in meta.yaml with fields from this file.  Jinja2 is
                 not done on clobbered fields.
   
          -m VARIANT_CONFIG_FILES, --variant-config-files VARIANT_CONFIG_FILES
                 Additional  variant  config  files  to add. These yaml files can
                 contain keys such as `c_compiler` and `target_platform` to  form
                 a build matrix.
   
          --old-build-string
                 Disable hash additions to filenames to distinguish package vari‐
                 ants from one another. NOTE: any filename collisions  are  yours
                 to  handle.  Any  variants with overlapping names within a build
                 will clobber each other.
   
          --check
                 Only check (validate) the recipe.
   
          --no-anaconda-upload
                 Do not ask to upload the package to anaconda.org.
   
          --no-include-recipe
                 Don't include the recipe inside the built package.
   
          -s, --source
                 Only obtain the source (but don't build).
   
          -t, --test
                 Test package (assumes package  is  already  built).   RECIPE_DIR
                 argument  can  be  either recipe directory, in which case source
                 download may be necessary to resolve packageversion, or path  to
                 built  package  .tar.bz2 file, in which case no source is neces‐
                 sary.
   
          --no-test
                 Do not test the package.
   
          -b, --build-only
                 Only run the build, without  any  post  processing  or  testing.
                 Implies --no-test and --no-anaconda-upload.
   
          -p, --post
                 Run   the  post-build  logic.  Implies  --no-test  and  --noana‐
                 conda-upload.
   
          --skip-existing
                 Skip  recipes  for  which  there  already  exists  an   existing
                 build(locally or in the channels).
   
          --keep-old-work
                 Do  not remove anything from environment, even after successful‐
                 build and test.
   
          --dirty
                 Do not remove work directory or _build environment, to speed  up
                 debugging. Does not apply patches or download source.
   
          -q, --quiet
                 do not display progress bar
   
          --debug
                 Show debug output from source checkouts and conda
   
          --token TOKEN
                 Token to pass through to anaconda upload
   
          --user USER
                 User/organization to upload packages to on anaconda.org or pypi
   
          --no-force-upload
                 Disable force upload to anaconda.org, preventing overwriting any
                 existing packages
   
          --no-activate
                 do not activate the build and test envs; just prepend to PATH
   
          --no-build-id
                 do not generate unique build folder names. Use if having  issues
                 with paths being too long.
   
          --croot CROOT
                 Build  root  folder.  Equivalent  to CONDA_BLD_PATH, but applies
                 only to this call of conda-build.
   
          --verify
                 do not run verification on recipes or packages when building
   
          --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                 folder to dump output package to.  Package  are  moved  here  if
                 build  or  test succeeds. Destination folder must exist prior to
                 using this.
   
          --no-prefix-length-fallback
                 Disable fallback to older 80 character prefix length if environ‐
                 ment  creation fails due to insufficient prefix length in depen‐
                 dency packages
   
          --prefix-length-fallback
                 Disable fallback to older 80 character prefix length if environ‐
                 ment  creation fails due to insufficient prefix length in depen‐
                 dency packages
   
          --prefix-length _PREFIX_LENGTH
                 length of build prefix. For packages with  binaries  that  embed
                 the path, this is critical to ensuring that your package can run
                 as many places as possible.  Notethat this value can be  altered
                 by  the  OS  below  conda-build  (e.g.  encrypted filesystems on
                 Linux), and you should prefer to set --croot to a  non-encrypted
                 location instead, so that you maintain a known prefix length.
   
          --no-locking
                 Disable  locking,  to  avoid  unresolved  race condition issues.
                 Unsafe to run multiplebuilds at once on  one  system  with  this
                 set.
   
          --no-remove-work-dir
                 Disable removal of the work dir before testing. Be careful using
                 this option, as you package may depend on  files  that  are  not
                 included  in the package, and may passtests, but ultimately fail
                 on installed systems.
   
          --long-test-prefix
                 Use a long prefix for the test prefix, as well as the build pre‐
                 fix.  Affects  only  Linux  and  Mac.  Prefix length matches the
                 --prefix-length flag. This is on by default in conda-build 3.0+
   
          --no-long-test-prefix
                 Do not use a long prefix for the test prefix,  as  well  as  the
                 build prefix. Affects only Linux and Mac.  Prefix length matches
                 the --prefix-length flag.
   
          --keep-going, -k
                 When running tests, keep going after each failure.   Default  is
                 to stop on the first failure.
   
          --cache-dir CACHE_DIR
                 Path to store the source files (archives, git clones, etc.) dur‐
                 ing the build.
   
          --no-copy-test-source-files
                 Disables copying the files necessary  for  testing  the  package
                 into  the  info/test  folder. Passing this argument means it may
                 not be possible to test the  package  without  internet  access.
                 There is also a danger that the source archive(s) containing the
                 files could become unavailable sometime in the future.
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are  URLs
                 searched  in  the  order  they  are given (including file:// for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are  searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can use
                 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda,  and  'system'
                 to  get  the  system  packages,  which  also takes .condarc into
                 account. You can also  use  any  name  and  the  .condarc  chan‐
                 nel_alias  value will be prepended. The default channel_alias is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
      PyPI upload parameters (twine):
          --password PASSWORD
                 password to use when uploading packages to pypi
   
          --sign SIGN
                 sign files when uploading to pypi
   
          --sign-with SIGN_WITH
                 program to use to sign files when uploading to pypi
   
          --identity IDENTITY
                 GPG identity to use to sign files when uploading to pypi
   
          --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                 path to .pypirc file to use when uploading to pypi
   
          --repository REPOSITORY, -r REPOSITORY
                 PyPI repository to upload to
   
      conda commands available from other packages:
                 build convert  develop  env  index  inspect  metapackage  render
                 skeleton verify
