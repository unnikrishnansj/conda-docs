   NAME
          conda - conda remove
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage: conda remove [-h] [-y] [--dry-run] [--json] [--all] [--features]
   
          [--no-pin] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels]
                 [-n    ENVIRONMENT   |   -p   PATH]   [-q]   [--use-index-cache]
                 [--use-local] [--offline] [package_name [package_name ...]]
   
          Remove a list of packages from a  specified  conda  environment.   Nor‐
          mally,  only  the  specified  package  is removed, and not the packages
          which may depend on the package.  Hence this  command  should  be  used
          with caution.  Note:  conda uninstall is an alias for conda remove.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          package_name
                 Package names to remove from the environment.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -y, --yes
                 Do not ask for confirmation.
   
          --dry-run
                 Only display what would have been done.
   
          --json Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda programmati‐
                 cally.
   
          --all  Remove all packages, i.e., the entire environment.
   
          --features
                 Remove features (instead of packages).
   
          --no-pin
                 Ignore pinned file.
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are  URLs
                 searched  in  the  order  they  are given (including file:// for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are  searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can use
                 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda,  and  'system'
                 to  get  the  system  packages,  which  also takes .condarc into
                 account. You can also  use  any  name  and  the  .condarc  chan‐
                 nel_alias  value will be prepended. The default channel_alias is
                 http://conda.binstar.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                 Name of environment (in envs dirs).
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 Full path to environment prefix (default: envs  dirs/build-envi‐
                 ronment).
   
          -q, --quiet
                 Do not display progress bar.
   
          --use-index-cache
                 Use cache of channel index files.
   
          --use-local
                 Use locally built packages.
   
          --offline
                 Offline mode, don't connect to the Internet.
